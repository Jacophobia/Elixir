# Overview

This is a sorting algorithm written in the Elixir programming language. 

I had never written anything in a pure functional programming language before, so I decided to give it a try and I wrote this.

# Development Environment

I used the Elixir programming language to write this. It is run using mix in the erlang virtual environment.

# Useful Websites

* [Documentation](https://elixir-lang.org/)

# Future Work

* Finish writing test cases for each function (love Elixir's built in testing tools)
* Finish the algorithm so that it is fully functional in ALL cases
* Write a program which is multithreaded next
